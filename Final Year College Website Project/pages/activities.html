            <p>The present scenario to get placement is not tough but most of the employers put forward SOFT SKILLS as
                an essential requirement which means students should have capabilities to speak English well and to
                write correct English. These qualities are lacking in most of the students but if any student is keen to
                develop these soft skills, it can be assured that this can be developed by our system of grooming the
                students without any extra expenses.
