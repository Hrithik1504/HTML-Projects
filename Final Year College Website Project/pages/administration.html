        <h1>Administration</h1>
        <p>The College Administration led by the Administrative officer & Assistant Academic Head, works with students,
            academic and support staff to ensure the effective administration of all matters of student recruitment,
            admissions, enrollment, teaching and assessment time-tabling, the recording and processing of marks, student
            achievement statistics and course approval, monitoring and review. Student support and guidance are also
            integral parts of College Administration. The College Administration also processes student's complaints,
            academic appeals, student disciplinary cases and issues related to data protection and freedom of
            information. In spite of all the achievements, there are always room for further development. We need to
            expand our existing building in very near future. But as we have seen in the past, with the support from all
            quarters, we believe that we will be able to tide over all the hurdles and become a model of technical
            education among the polytechnics.</p>

                <h3>From The Chairman's Desk IMPS Polytechnic College</h3>
                <p>What one sincerely hopes and dreams about does come true, provided it is backed and activated by
                    endeavors. Yes, we hope to see IMPS Polytechnic College as a premier institution of engineering.
                    In an endeavour to develop a centre of excellence, the synergy of complete Educational Institute
                    should generate top of mind awareness to various segment of society. The aspiring and ambitious
                    young generation should look forward to a value based institutional setup – moral fiber
                    discipline, indignity and on top pleasing manners. These sterling elements in character, as you
                    know, are so rear in this day’s multitude of student, who lacks opportunity to receive the best
                    of education. Just bit about bush. They become confused before stepping upon a right track.<br><br>

                    With this purpose IMPS Educational Trust was founded in 2000 which then subsequently established
                    IMPS College of Engineering and Technology in 2003. It passed through hitches and glitches to
                    reach a height of glory. The technical and research discipline, I am sure, will be quite
                    intriguing in Universe of true education and compare the best in the world. The learning process
                    and motivation with interest will enlarge the vision that will make individuals true
                    professionals. The Engineering Institute had been located in Malda to add new dimension in
                    education sphere of North Bengal and adjoining States. In its efforts to add feather to the
                    education sphere IMPS is establishing a Polytechnic College at Chewara Para, Jalpaiguri. The
                    Institute is aimed at training and grooming students who want to join Industry earlier i.e.,
                    right after their School final examination. It will also provide scope to the students who want
                    to study Engineering but do not want to attend the conventional plus two or senior / higher
                    secondary scheme of studies. Students qualifying the three years Diploma can join full time B.
                    Tech courses directly in the second year through lateral entry scheme.<br><br>

                    The team of faculty provides guidance with qualitative aspects to built carrier acceptable to
                    ‘Blue chip organization’ the scholars should also be groomed to become entrepreneur in their own
                    initiative. IMPS Polytechnic College, Jalpaiguri is the path way that I am sure will lead to
                    progress with live wire passion and dynamism. We will also carry on with Production Unit at IMPS
                    PTC. We will produce industry standard tools and machineries with the help of our laboratory and
                    workshop equipment. Students will get opportunities for a hands-on in those units.<br></p>

                <h3>Principal's Message</h3>
                <p>It is my privilege to warmly welcome all to the portals of this great institution dedicated to the
                    cause of top quality technical education with the motto of taking you to tomorrow’s technology. To
                    start with I can say that I am a proud principal of IMPS Polytechnic College, Jalpaiguri. Taking
                    challenges are part of life. From around 15 years of experiences in the industry, academics and
                    skill development sector my challenge is to transform the grooming bud IMPS PTC to the high
                    demanding destination of students from all round Bengal. The bud had started its journey in the year
                    2015 and I’m getting associated with this institution since 2016. Though I am new to this
                    institution, before its I was the Deputy Director of West Bengal State Council. I will pour my
                    effort to the level best to earn a good name for this institution. The Management Team, Faculties of
                    this institution are so enthusiastic. We as a team will work hard, will decide collectively and will
                    act accordingly for the welfare of our jewels (our students). We had started our journey with four
                    streams of Polytechnic. They are Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering
                    and Computer Science and Technology. In each trade we have intake capacity of 60. We promise to
                    provide best ever possible education to our students through the wellthought decision of the
                    Management and by implementing those through our experienced faculties and staffs. We will groom our
                    students in Group Discussion, Extempore, Mock Interview etc so that they can face the job interviews
                    with ease besides of providing basics of only Technical Education in their respective streams. Not
                    only that we will provide our students best ever possible opportunities to grab job to start with in
                    the form of Campus Recruitment drives. We will motivate our students to perform through hard work,
                    dedication , motivation. For that we are seeking full co-operation from everybody associated with
                    the students by taking regular feedbacks from the Head of the Departments and act promptly for any
                    adverse reporting about any of the student. Suggestions are always welcome to enhance us, transform
                    us to provide better service and to create World leaders for the future. We will also train our
                    students in industry oriented technologies every year so that from the day one they can become
                    productive in the industry. Therefore the choice of an institution has a crucial impact factor for
                    the future. Good academics, infrastructure and placements are our priority. This encompasses the
                    entire gamut of activities associated with holistic development of a student to face the dynamic
                    Global challenges. The exemplary infrastructural facilities, the team of highly qualified,
                    experienced and dedicated faculty and supporting staff and the exhilarating atmosphere in the campus
                    will surely take you to enviable heights in your capabilities and achievements. Our institute
                    believes in learning for life which inspires us to equip our students with the skills to learn and

            <div class="director-msg">
                <h3>Directors's Message</h3>
                <p>Nothing can be more satisfying than to witness a fifteen year old technical institution ushering into
                    the digital age with its own website. It took few years before IMPS Polytechnic finds its own
                    premises at the present location and from 2015 this polytechnic began its functioning from here.<br><br>
                    67 years after Independence, India is now in the field of rapid development. If is now in a leading
                    position in the world. India, which has one of the ancient cultures in the world, is now taking
                    stride in Technological Developments. It is in need of skilled Technical Manpower. While Engineering
                    Degree Colleges are coming up very fast there is lag in the development of Diploma Institutions. The
                    country is, therefore, facing a shortage in Diploma Engineers. The All India Council for Technical
                    Education is seized of this matter and is encouraging the development of more Polytechnics.<br><br>
                    Being academicians, our aim is to inculcate technical knowledge, skills and wisdom, through
                    projectbased learning, and quality teaching by accomplished, dedicated faculty. We prepare students
                    such that when they leave the institution after four years of intensive learning, they are industry
                    ready engineers, ready to face any challenge.<br><br>
                    As we increase our knowledge, our thirst for more knowledge becomes unquenchable. Here our students
                    grow the desire to learn more, through Outcome based Teaching - Learning Process. Action is the key
                    word for an engineer. We aim to provide students with more opportunities to learn in a practical way
                    through various student activities and scientific-projects.<br><br>
                    In the end I would like to quote the words of Benjamin Franklin, ‘An investment in knowledge pays
                    the best interest’... Hope dies hard, and it, at the same time, is a common human nature to resolve
                    for turning over a new leaf even in the face of odds. So I welcome you all to help SIP go ahead in
                    new tracks with new records of achievements. Thank you and wish you all sunny seconds.
                    Overall mission of the Institute is to produce good human being in the professional world.</p>
