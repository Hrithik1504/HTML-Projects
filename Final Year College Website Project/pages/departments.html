      <div class="department-col">
        <p>As we know the today’s world is dumb without “information”. Almost everything depends on “Historical”
          as well as “Real time” information. Information includes all forms of processed data – and the
          processing is not conceivable without computers (in its all forms). There is a big role of Internet for the
          Economic growth and stability of a prosperous country. Hence we can dream of a bright future for the
          students of CST. Computer Science and Engineering marked an epoch in IT Industry. CST Students have
          admittedly knowledge and expertise in Computer science. Applications of CAD, CAM and ancillary
          exercises should be of utmost priority in industrial hegemony and behavioral science. Engineering by all
          counts has been immensely activated, overcame itches and problems of' blind spots' of contemporary
          industries. Computers in Engineering boost up the efficiency more than edge. So, move on with IMPS with
          greater zeal.<br>
          In total 3 years curriculum several subjects like Data Structure & Algorithm, Data Base Management
          System, Object Oriented Programming, Software Engineering, Computer Organization and Architecture,
          Operating System, Computer Network, Numerical Methods, Automata Theory, Compiler Design is covered.
          Students are also aware with some advance topic like Distributed Computing, Cloud Computing,
          Artificial Intelligence, Image Processing, Soft Computing etc. In the department students are getting prepared
          for
          focusing in the IT industry.

      <h1>Electrical Engineering</h1>
      <div class="department-col">
        <p>Electrical engineering deals with the application of electrical energy to make the world doable by generating
          and transmitting the electrical power from one corner to other using different types of electrical equipments.
          It is the most important sector in Engineering that deals with study & application of electricity, electronics
          and electromagnetism. Generally, Electrical Engineering deals with problems associated with large-scale
          electrical system like generation transmission and motor control.<br>
          The Department of Electrical Engineering is continuing from the date of its inception with a mission of
          imparting teaching and promoting implementation of practical aspects to build a solid foundation as a part of
          the Engineering Education. It has the motto to brighten the face of this institution to the centre of
          excellence in this core field. This Department contains well experienced highly qualified young and dynamic
          faculties with an ability to provide quality teaching. The Department strives to impart up-todate technical
          knowledge and skills and produce well-qualified engineers, who will make qualitative difference in this field.
          Inculcate professional responsibilities to play leadership roles along their diverse career paths and develop
          capability to utilise engineering skills in industry, research centres, national laboratories and
          entrepreneurship development. Develop a diverse range of theoretical skills and practical experience,
          presented in the context of real applications and design experience.<br>
          The Diploma is a sure gate way to self employment as well as lucrative employment opportunities in the
          industry. Electrical Engineers closely maintain and monitor the functioning of motors, dynamos, electrical
          panels, etc. that greatly impact production and the revenues of any production unit. The program imparts
          hands-on skills to make students industry ready. After completion of this program, students can also take
          admission directly to the second year of electrical engineering through lateral entry mode.

          The key features of the profession are its breadth, flexibility, and individuality. The career paths of
          mechanical engineers are largely determined by individual choices, a decided advantage in a changing world.
          Mechanical engineering is a diverse subject that derives its breadth from the need to design and manufacture
          everything from small individual parts to large systems . The role of a mechanical engineer is to take a
          product from an idea to the marketplace. In order to accomplish this, a broad range of skills are needed. The
          mechanical engineer needs to acquire particular skills and knowledge.<br>

          Environmental, Construction, Transportation, Geo-technical, Materials, Coastal and Municipal. This department
          of this Institute is actively working in the thrust areas like hazardous waste management, air pollution and
          monitoring, waste water treatment, environmental audit and impact assessment, Surveying, Highway and
          Transportation systems, Hydraulic and hydrologic analysis, ground water flow and pollutant transport, water
          conservation practices and simulation and modelling of water resources systems. Civil engineers are employed
          in all the major construction projects carried out by the state or central government, the railways, private
          construction companies, military, engineering services, etc.<br>
          Since its inception, it is growing up steadily with the valuable guidance of Administration, co-operation of
          the Faculties and Heads of other departments, Staff of Office and Hostels. The departmental faculties are well
          experienced consisting younger and older generations. Very senior professors of eminent universities are also
          available in this department as advisors. Besides, the laboratories are modern, spacious and well equipped.
          Students in every year attend the short survey camp and educational tour. Last year many of our students
          attended industrial training in eminent public and private organizations.
